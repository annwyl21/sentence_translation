# sentence_translation
Code to translate a sentence into the languages that I study daily on Duolingo,  connecting to an Azure API.

- Takes a sentence from an html page
- Detects the language it was written in
- Sends that sentence to the API
- Returns the same sentence translated into 5 languages; spanish, french, dutch, german and scottish gaelic, displayed on the html page.

###Challenges Overcome:
- Learning to connect to an Azure API
- Learning how to store a development key as a locally stored environmental variable so that it is not published on github.
- Learning to use flash to run a dynamic webpage (one that uses code in the background to react to the user)
